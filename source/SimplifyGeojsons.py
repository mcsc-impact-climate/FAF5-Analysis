    Converts input shapefiles to geojson, and reduces their granularity (and size) for quick visualization.
    If a shapefile results in more than 60,000 features, it merges geometries to reduce the count.

    ----------
    shapefiles: dict
        Dictionary mapping names to shapefile paths relative to the data directory.
    columns_keep: dict
        Dictionary of lists of column names to retain for specific shapefiles.
    coordinate: int, optional

    tolerance: float, optional
        Simplification tolerance for geometry vertex reduction. Default is 1000.
